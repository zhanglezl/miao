    View source is a feature,not a bug. Thanks for your curiosity and interst in participating!
    Here are the submission guidelines for the new and improved csszengarden,com:]
    -CSS3? Of course! Prefix for ALL browsers where  necessary.
    -go responsive; test your at multiple screen sizes.
    -your brower testing baseline;IE9+, rencent Chrome/Fire/Safari,and IOS/Android
    -Graceful degradation is acceptable,and in fact highly encouraged.
    -use classes for styling.Don't use ids.
    -web fonts are cool,just make sure you have the license to share the files.Hosted services that are applied via the CSS file (ie.Google Fonts) will work fine,but most that require custom HTML won't.TypeKit is supported,see the readme on this page for usage instructions:https://github.com/mezzoblue/csszengarden.com/

    And a few tips on building your CSS file:
    -use:first-child, :last-child and :nth-child to get a non-classed elements
    -use::before and ::after to creat presudo-elements for extra styling
    -use multiple background images to apply as many as you need to any element
    -use the Kellum Method for image replacement,if still needed.http://goo.go/GXxdI
    -don't rely on the extra divs at the bottom. Use：：before and ::after instead.

        <h3>The Road to Enlightenment</h3>
        <p>Littering a dark and dreary road lay the past relics of browser-specific tags,imcompatible
            <abbr title="Document Object Model">DOM</abbr>s, broken <abbr title="Cascading Stytle Sheets">CSS</abbr>
            support, and abandoned browsers.</p>
        <p>We must clear the mind of the past. Web enlightenment has been achieved thanks to the tireless
            efforts of folk like the <abbr title="Word Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr>,<abbr
                title="Web Standards Projects">WaSP</abbr>
            ,and the major browsers creators</p>
        <p>The CSS Zen garden invite you to relax and meditate on the important lessons of the masters.
            Begin to see with clarity. Learn to use time-honored techniques in new invigorating fashion. Become one with

            <h3>So What Is About?</h3>
            <p>There is a continuing need to show the power of <abbr title="Cascading Stytle Sheets">CSS</abbr>. The Zen
                Garden aims to excite, inspire and encourage paticipation. To begin, view some of the existing designs
                in the list. Clicking on any one will load the style sheet into this vert page.The <abbr
                    title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr>remains the same, the only thing that has changesd is
                the external <abbr title="Cascading Stytle Sheets"></abbr>file. Yes, really.</p>
            <p><abbr title="Cascading Stytle Sheets">CSS</abbr>allows complete and total control over the style of a
                hyper text document. The only way this can be illustrated in a way get people excited is demonstrating
                what it can truly be , once the reins are placed in the hands of those able to creat beauty from
                structure.Designers and coders alike contributed to the beauty of web；we can always push it further.</p>

                starting points.Please see the <a href="http://www.mezzoblue.com/zargarden/resourse/"

            <h3>Requirements</h3>
            <p>Where possible, we could like to see mostly <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets,Levels 1 and
2">CSS 1 &amp; 2</abbr>usage. <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets, levels 3 and 4">CSS 3 &amp;4</abbr>
                should be limited to widely-supported elements only, or strong fallbacks should be provided. The CSS Zen
                Garden is about functional, pracital<abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>and not the lastet
                bleeding-edge tricks viewable by 2% of browsing public. The onlt real requirement we have is that your
                <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>validates.</p>
            <p>Luckily,desiging this way shows how well various browsers have implemented <abbr
                    title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>by now.When sticking to the guidelines you should see
                fairly consistent results across most modern browsers. Due to the sheer numbers of user agents on the
                web these days&#8212; especially when factor in mobile &#8212; pix-perfect layouts may not be possible
                across every
                platform. That &#8212; s okay, but do test as many as you can. Your design should work in at least IE9+
                and
                the latest Chrome, Chrome, Firefox,IOS and Android browers(run by over 90% of the population.)</p>
